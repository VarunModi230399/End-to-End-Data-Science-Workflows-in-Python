# End to End Data Science Workflows in Python

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates **end-to-end data science workflows** using Python, covering data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and machine learning. It also includes **web scraping projects** to collect and process real-world data for analysis.

The focus is on applying practical data science techniques to extract insights, uncover patterns, and build predictive models using structured datasets and live web data.

## Key Highlights
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Performed data cleaning, exploration, and visualizations using **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.  
- **Web Scraping:** Extracted and processed structured data from live websites for analytical purposes.  
- **Machine Learning:** Applied **scikit-learn** to build predictive models, perform regression and classification tasks, and analyze patterns in datasets.  

## Outcome
This project provides hands-on experience in **Python-based data science and machine learning workflows**, demonstrating the ability to work with real datasets, visualize insights, and create predictive models. It also shows proficiency in **web scraping** to acquire external data for analysis.
